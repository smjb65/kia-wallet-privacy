  <h1>Privacy Policy for Kia Wallet</h1>
  <p>Last Updated: August 15, 2025</p>
  <p>Kia Wallet is a Chrome extension that allows users to manage Ethereum wallets securely. We do not collect, store, or transfer any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data to third parties. The only data handled is the user's encrypted wallet information (e.g., mnemonic phrase), which is stored locally in chrome.storage.local and accessible only with the user's password.</p>
  <p>We do not sell, share, or use this data for any purpose other than enabling the wallet's functionality. No remote servers or external services are involved in data processing.</p>
